# Handwritten Digit RecognitionThis project is focused on building a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using the MNIST dataset. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras.## Files### main.py- **Purpose**: The `main.py` script is responsible for training a neural network model on the MNIST dataset and evaluating its performance.- **Usage**: To run this script, use the following command:  ```bash  python main.py### predict.py- **Purpose**: The `predict.py` script is responsible for taking the image's path as input (image can be of any size, but it should consist of single digit) and prints the number predicted by the model.- **Usage**: To run this script, use the following command:  ```bash  python predict.py
